# inchworm

A daemon and CLI for configuring fallible, repeated agentic processes on local models. inchworm schedules and sequences work per repository and reports success rates and specific failure conditions. It runs agents through [nanna](https://github.com/DominicBurkart/nanna-coder), which sets up sub-agents with fixed capabilities and runs them in per-repo containers.

## Status: partial, and not yet aligned with the project design

This is milestone 1 of an MVP: configuration, run state, a SQLite store and offline validation. It cannot run an agent yet.

It was written from a planning conversation, not from the project's design. The design is issue [#1](https://github.com/DominicBurkart/inchworm/issues/1) and `DESIGN.md`, which exists only on the unmerged branch `ccr-a1899a5f-disb85`. Where the two differ, the design wins. The differences are tracked in issue [#6](https://github.com/DominicBurkart/inchworm/issues/6):

- **D1, not met**: a directory is configured here by a global `[[repo]]` list plus `.inchworm/flows.toml`, not by a per-directory `inchworm.toml`; there is no `register`, `unregister` or `list`.
- **D2, not met**: there are no offramps (`noop`, `issue`, `escalate`).
- **D3, not met**: there are no per-step auditors; the model has judges after a run.
- **D4, partial**: only the issue-to-draft-PR journey exists. The tagged `trigger` is the extension point for the CI-failure and merge-conflict journeys; any other `kind` is rejected with an "unknown variant" error.
- **D5, not addressed**: the marigold/Rust control-flow split and the fate of the prototype branch are undecided.
- **D6, not met**: `DESIGN.md` is not on `main`.

Everything below describes what this code does today.

## Merging has no default

A flow must state its outcome: `outcome` and `outcome.mode` are required and have no default. `merge_when` exists as a mode and is validated, but no shipped example uses it, and `inchworm validate` warns when a flow turns it on. The intended direction is that merging becomes a capability a user grants to a nanna subagent or another agent, with the user defining when and how (nanna-coder issue 1043). Do not enable `merge_when` in a real repository.

## Commands

```
inchworm validate [--config PATH]
```

Exit codes:

- `0`: everything validated
- `1`: at least one repository has errors (listed on stdout)
- `2`: the command could not run: bad usage, no config could be found, or the config could not be read or parsed (the reason is on stderr)

`validate` is offline. It does not talk to GitHub, nanna or a model. It needs `HOME` only when the config uses `~`, and the default config location needs `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` or `HOME`.

For the global config it checks that `nanna_bin` is an executable file or, for a bare name, that it is on `PATH`. For every repository it checks:

- the path is a git repository (a `.git` file or symlink must lead to a gitdir that exists)
- `.inchworm/flows.toml` passes the flow rules below
- every `llm` judge rubric exists and is a regular file inside `.inchworm/`
- `.nanna/protected.toml` follows nanna's entry rules and lists `.inchworm/**`
- `.nanna/prompt.md` exists (a warning only)

The repo-controlled files above (`.inchworm`, `.nanna` and everything read from them) are read only if no component of the path under the repository root is a symlink, each is a regular file, and each is read with a size cap: 256 KiB for `flows.toml`, 64 KiB for `protected.toml`, 4 KiB for a `.git` file. The global config may itself be a symlink (for example from home-manager), but must resolve to a regular file of at most 256 KiB.

What a passing `validate` proves: the files inchworm reads are well formed, `.inchworm/**` is declared protected, and nothing it reads escapes the repository through a symlink. The `protected.toml` check mirrors `validate_extra` in nanna-coder `harness/src/protected.rs` as of nanna-coder commit `239a1c94`; it does not run nanna's code, so a later change there is not tracked. It does not prove that identities named in flows exist, that labels exist, or that branch protection matches `required_checks`; those online checks are not built yet.

## Global config

`~/.config/inchworm/config.toml` (or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/inchworm/config.toml`):

```toml
nanna_bin = "nanna"
ollama_url = "http://localhost:11434"
concurrency = 1
poll_secs = 120

[[repo]]
slug = "DominicBurkart/marigold"
path = "~/code/marigold"
```

- `nanna_bin` and each repo `path` may start with `~`, which needs `HOME` set to an absolute path. After expansion every repo path must be absolute. A path to a binary must exist: the example above resolves `nanna` on `PATH` and fails `validate` if it is not there.
- Defaults: `ollama_url = "http://localhost:11434"`, `concurrency = 1` (1 to 64), `poll_secs = 120` (1 to 86400). `state_db` is optional and, when unset, defaults to `~/.local/state/inchworm/state.db`; `validate` never reads it.
- Repo slugs are `owner/name` (case-insensitively unique), and no two repos may share a path.
- Unknown keys are rejected everywhere.

## Flows

`.inchworm/flows.toml` in each repository:

```toml
[[flow]]
name = "issue"
trigger = { kind = "label", label = "inchworm" }
base = "main"
max_attempts = 3
retry_on = ["model_error", "agent_failed", "tests_failed", "orchestrator_lost", "judge_rejected"]
attempt_timeout_secs = 7200

[[flow.step]]
name = "implement"
identity = "rust-implementer"

[[flow.step]]
name = "publish"
identity = "pr-shepherd"

[[flow.judge]]
kind = "diff"
max_lines = 400
forbid_paths = [".github/**"]

[[flow.judge]]
kind = "nanna_clean"

[[flow.judge]]
kind = "llm"
rubric = ".inchworm/rubric.md"
model = "gemma4:e4b"
min_score = 7

[flow.outcome]
mode = "draft_pr"
required_checks = ["Tests"]
```

- Required: `name`, `trigger`, at least one `step`, and `outcome` with its `mode`. Defaults: `base = "main"`, `max_attempts = 3`, `attempt_timeout_secs = 7200`. `retry_on` defaults to **empty**, so nothing is retried unless you list failure classes, even though `max_attempts` defaults to 3. `judge` defaults to none and `outcome.merge_method` to `merge`.
- Names and labels: a flow name is 1 to 64 characters of letters, digits, `.`, `_` or `-`, not starting with `.`, unique ignoring case. Two flows may not share a trigger label (ignoring case).
- Bounds, counted in characters, not bytes: a file holds at most 32 flows; a trigger label is at most 50 characters; a flow has at most 20 steps and at most 20 judges; a step name is at most 64 characters; a model is at most 100 characters; a rubric path is at most 200 characters; a `forbid_paths` glob is at most 200 characters and a diff judge has at most 256 of them; a `required_checks` entry is at most 200 characters and `outcome` has at most 64 of them. Step names, trigger labels, rubric paths, models, base branches, `forbid_paths` entries and `required_checks` entries may not contain control characters (newline, tab and NUL included).
- A rubric must be a relative path under `.inchworm/` (no `..`, no absolute path), so agents, which cannot write `.inchworm/**`, cannot change what judges read.
- `retry_on` may not repeat a class or list `cancelled` or `escalated`, and needs `max_attempts` of at least 2. `max_attempts` is 1 to 20 and `attempt_timeout_secs` is 1 to 604800.
- `mode = "merge_when"` also requires at least one judge and a non-empty `required_checks`. See "Merging has no default" above.
- Unknown keys are rejected everywhere.

## State store

`inchworm::store` is a SQLite store of runs and attempts. No command uses it yet. Runs are keyed by a subject (an issue number, a pull request number or a full commit id) and a flow; only one open run per subject and flow can exist, and a finished subject can run again. Several processes can use the same file. After a crash, `Store::recover_after_crash` needs a `DaemonLock` for the same database (an exclusive lock on its resolved path), fails attempts the dead daemon left dispatched as `orchestrator_lost`, puts `running` runs back in the queue (or in `awaiting_ci` when a pull request was already recorded) and reports the runs in `awaiting_ci` and `judging` for the daemon to resume. The lock only protects against processes that take it. A database created by an earlier unreleased build fails to open with a clear error; delete it.

## Development

The pre-commit hook runs fmt, clippy, tests, doctests, audit, deny, docs, a security review of the staged diff and a coverage no-regression check against the merge base with `origin/main` (or `INCHWORM_COVERAGE_BASE`). The review must start with exactly `VERDICT: SAFE` on its first line and contain no `VERDICT: UNSAFE` line (`scripts/review-verdict.sh`). `cargo-husky` installs the hook on `cargo test`; in a git worktree it cannot, so copy `.cargo-husky/hooks/pre-commit` into the repository's hooks directory by hand.

The toolchain is the `stable` channel with rustfmt and clippy. It is not pinned to a version, so it moves with each stable release. CI runs fmt, clippy, tests, doctests, audit, deny, the docs build and the coverage comparison with the pull request's base commit; it does not run the security review, which is local only.

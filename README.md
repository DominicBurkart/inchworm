# inchworm

A daemon and CLI for configuring fallible, repeated agentic processes on local models. inchworm schedules and sequences work per repository and reports success and failure rates and the specific failure conditions. It runs agents through [nanna](https://github.com/DominicBurkart/nanna-coder), which sets up sub-agents with fixed capabilities and runs them in per-repo containers.

## Status

Milestones 1 and 2 of the MVP: configuration, run state, the SQLite store, offline and online validation, and dispatch of a flow to nanna through `inchworm run`. CI waiting, judges, the outcome policy, the daemon and stats are not implemented yet.

## Commands

```
inchworm validate [--config PATH] [--online] [--build-images]
inchworm run <repo-slug-or-path> <issue> [--flow NAME] [--config PATH]
```

Exit codes: `0` valid, `1` the repos have errors, `2` the config could not be read.

`validate` checks, for every repo in the global config:

- the path is a git repository
- `.inchworm/flows.toml` parses and passes its rules
- every rubric file referenced by an `llm` judge exists
- `.nanna/protected.toml` lists `.inchworm/**` so agents cannot edit their own flows or judges
- `.nanna/prompt.md` exists (warning only)

With `--online` it also checks that every step identity resolves with `nanna agents list --repo <path>` and that the trigger label and the `inchworm:running`, `inchworm:failed` and `inchworm:done` labels exist on GitHub (through `gh`). `--build-images` implies `--online` and runs `nix build git+file://<repo>#devContainerImage --no-link --no-write-lock-file` for each repo.

**`--build-images` runs the repository's own Nix code on this machine.** Evaluating a flake executes the Nix expressions in `flake.nix` and everything it imports, and builds may fetch from the network. That is the one place inchworm itself runs repo-controlled code on the host, so use the flag only on repositories you trust. It reads tracked files only (`git+file`), so untracked files such as `.env` are not copied into the world-readable Nix store, and it never rewrites the repo's `flake.lock`. Nanna builds the same image for real runs; this flag only checks it early.

`run` executes one flow for one issue in the foreground. It starts `nanna mcp-serve`, sends each step as an `assign_task` to the step's identity (passing the previous step's summary and patch forward), stops at the first failing step, classifies the failure into a `FailureClass`, retries per `retry_on` and `max_attempts`, and records everything in the SQLite store. After the final step it looks up the pull request on `inchworm/<issue>-a<attempt>` with `gh`, records its head SHA, and leaves the run in `awaiting_ci`. A step output that touches `.inchworm/**` is rejected as `protected_path_violation` regardless of nanna's own protected set. A step other than the last (or the only step) that produces no changes fails as `empty_patch`. Exit codes: `0` PR recorded, `1` the run failed, `2` setup error.

## Global config

`~/.config/inchworm/config.toml` (or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/inchworm/config.toml`):

```toml
nanna_bin = "~/.nix-profile/bin/nanna"
ollama_url = "http://localhost:11434"
concurrency = 1
poll_secs = 120
state_db = "~/.local/state/inchworm/state.db"

[[repo]]
slug = "DominicBurkart/marigold"
path = "~/code/marigold"
```

## Flows

`.inchworm/flows.toml` in each repo:

```toml
[[flow]]
name = "issue"
trigger = { kind = "label", label = "inchworm" }
base = "main"
max_attempts = 3
retry_on = ["model_error", "agent_failed", "tests_failed", "orchestrator_lost", "judge_rejected"]
attempt_timeout_secs = 7200

[[flow.step]]
name = "implement"
identity = "rust-implementer"

[[flow.step]]
name = "publish"
identity = "pr-shepherd"

[[flow.judge]]
kind = "diff"
max_lines = 400
forbid_paths = [".github/**"]

[[flow.judge]]
kind = "nanna_clean"

[[flow.judge]]
kind = "llm"
rubric = ".inchworm/rubric.md"
model = "gemma4:e4b"
min_score = 7

[flow.outcome]
mode = "draft_pr"
required_checks = ["Tests"]
```

`mode = "merge_when"` additionally requires at least one judge and a non-empty `required_checks`. Unknown keys are rejected everywhere.

### How steps hand work to each other

Each step is its own nanna task, and nanna creates a fresh worktree from `base` for every task. A later step therefore does not see an earlier step's files. It receives the earlier step's summary, file list and patch as text in its description. The patch is handed over whole or not at all: if a step other than the last produces a patch larger than 100,000 bytes, the flow stops with `patch_apply_failed` and says so; nothing is truncated.

Inchworm itself never applies, commits or pushes anything. The publish step (for example `pr-shepherd`) has to apply the patch it was given and push `inchworm/<issue>-a<attempt>` with nanna's own tools, and inchworm then looks that branch up with `gh`. **That hand-over has not been run end to end against a real nanna, a model and a container**; what is verified is the wire protocol with the real binary (see `tests/real_nanna.rs`) and the flow logic against a fake nanna. Treat the first real run as an experiment.

## Development

The pre-commit hook (installed by `cargo-husky` on `cargo test`, or copy `.cargo-husky/hooks/pre-commit` into the git hooks directory when working in a worktree) runs fmt, clippy, tests, doctests, audit, deny, docs, a security review of the staged diff and a coverage no-regression check against `main`.
